# Continuers To C - Comp Club Summer School '23 Exercises

### longestString.c

- Write a program that asks the user of names, until Ctrl-D is pressed. After Ctrl-D is pressed, print the longest name.

  Sample Output:
    ```
    Enter a name: Ash Ketcham
    Enter a name: Augustine Sycamore
    Enter a name: Professor Oak
    The longest name is Augustine Sycamore
    ```

### pokemonTypes.c

- Using an unsigned 16 bit integer, we can make a flag system where each bit represents a Gen I Pokemon Type. If a Pokemon has a type, we can 'turn the bit on' at the particular position. Using the bitwise operators introduced earlier, let us try to make functions that:
  - Add a type to a Pokemon
  - Remove a type from a Pokemon
  - Check a Pokemon is of a certain type
  - Count the number of types a Pokemon has
  - CHALLENGE: Return the number of common types between two Pokemons
- More details are in the slides

- More details can be found in the slides
